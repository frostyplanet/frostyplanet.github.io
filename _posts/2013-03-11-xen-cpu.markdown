title: evaluate overall cpu usage of a xen host
---
Lately I have been researching on monitoring xen cpu usage. 

As I know there is no easy way for a python program to get performance metrics from Xen hypervisor,
unless you want to mess up with low level library like libxc, or deploy the new XenAPI which came out in ubuntu 12.04.
And I dug in the xentop / libxenstat source, only to know that libxenstat and its python binding are not shipped with ubuntu.
But calculate cpu usage is a real simple job, the domain cpu_time used in "xentop" is in fact the same with the one in "xm list",
so I imported the python code in "xm" and got the job done (to get the data from xend, and I've skipped the XenAPI part).  You can find xenstat.py in my [pyxen repo](https://github.com/frostyplanet/pyxen).

Xen virtualize real cpus into multiple VCPUs. If a domU have 2 VCPUs, you may find its cpu usage in "xentop" between 0%-200%. 
In my xenstat.py I have

	total_cpu =  all_dom0_domU_cpu_time_elapse_sum  / time_elapse

run the program and compare it with the number of your real cpu cores, you can determine the server load. 

For example, on one of my physical machine (with 4 cores, 8 threads), I got these metrics:
	
	dom0_avg 0.497771679915
	total 3.12977395954
	dom0_avg 0.509708471051
	total 3.1375385183
	dom0_avg 0.506460638119
	total 2.86128270259
	dom0_avg 0.478186092127
	total 2.89359146408
